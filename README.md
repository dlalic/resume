# Resume

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dlalic/resume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dlalic/resume)

This is not a serious project, more of a `Rust` exercise. The goal is to have a resume structured in a human readable `yaml` and use it to populate `TeX`.

Didn't use [`tectonic`](https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/) due to external dependencies, render the output with local `XeLaTeX` due to custom font usage.
